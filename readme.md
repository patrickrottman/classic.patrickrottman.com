# classic.patrickpottman.com

Welcome to **classic.patrickrottman.com**, my first-ever website from over 15 years ago. It’s messy, it’s old-school, and it’s staying up forever as a tribute to where I started.

## What Is This?
This is the website where it all began. My dad taught me the basics of HTML, and this was my first creation. It’s got:
- `<marquee>` tags everywhere because they were cool at the time.
- `<center>` tags that definitely don’t work the way I thought.
- A form asking random stuff like if you have an iPod.
- GIFs, sound embeds, and even a clickable image that says "oww, that hurt!"

## Why Keep It?
Because it’s part of my history. It’s funny, it’s nostalgic, and honestly, it’s a good reminder of how far I’ve come.

## Features
- **Marquee Overload**: Everything is constantly moving.
- **2000s Vibes**: Bright colors, inline styles, and no CSS.
- **Pointless Forms**: Checkboxes that don’t do anything but look busy.
- **Old-School Chaos**: It’s random and kind of hilarious.

## See It Yourself

## How It’s Hosted
- HTML lives in a GitHub repo.
- GitHub Pages serves it.
- GoDaddy connects the custom subdomain.

## Disclaimer
This site is objectively bad, but that’s the point.

### Thanks
